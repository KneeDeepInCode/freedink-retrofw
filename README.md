# freedink-retrofw
A quick fix for the binary release of FreeDink for the RS97 portable system.

For some reason, they didn't release the source code for the port, and I haven't been able to piece together what was changed to re-compile from source myself.

The original RS97 binary release had some dependencies missing for RetroFW 2.x, so I unsquashfs'd it and added them in, with only minor other changes. Here is the final product.

It was last tested working on RetroFW 2.2 on the LDK Game.
